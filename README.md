# Problem Statement

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Scenario: A Cybersecurity Mystery**

As a cybersecurity analyst at a leading IT services firm, your day takes an unexpected turn when several clients report a critical issue: they can't access the website [www.yummyrecipesforme.com](http://www.yummyrecipesforme.com). Instead of the mouthwatering recipes they were expecting, users are greeted with a frustrating error message:

**"Destination port unreachable."**

You quickly verify the problem by attempting to visit the website yourself. The same error stares back at you‚Äîsomething is clearly wrong.

### üß© **The Puzzle**

Your mission? To analyze the situation, identify the affected network protocol, and resolve the issue to restore access to the website.

### üîç **Investigation Begins**

To get to the bottom of this, you load up your trusty network analyzer tool, `tcpdump`, and try accessing the website again. The investigation reveals a key clue: 

- When your browser sends a query to a DNS server using the UDP protocol, trying to retrieve the IP address for the website, something goes wrong.
- Instead of a successful response, you receive an ICMP packet with the ominous message: **"udp port 53 unreachable."**

### üï∏ **What's Going On?**

The evidence points to a disruption in the network communication, specifically involving the DNS protocol, which is crucial for resolving domain names like `www.yummyrecipesforme.com` into IP addresses. Without a functioning DNS, the browser can't find the server, and the website remains inaccessible.

Your challenge is to unravel this network mystery, identify why the DNS server isn't responding as expected, and ensure that `www.yummyrecipesforme.com` is back online, serving up delicious recipes to users once again.

Are you ready to dive deep into the network traffic and crack the case?
